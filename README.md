# pyCONDOR: Analyses of Intensity Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy

The presented tool aim at resolving the characteristic time of the processes behind an Intensity Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy (IMPS) spectrum. IMPS spectrum is transformed in a Distribution of Time Admittance (DTA) spectrum. This is peaked in values of time connected to characteristic times of the processes embedded in the charge carrier dynamic.
